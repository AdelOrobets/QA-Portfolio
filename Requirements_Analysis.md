## Requirements Analysis

**Requirements Analysis** is the process of understanding, documenting, 
and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software project. 
It serves as the foundation for designing and developing the software product.

### Key activities:

- Gathering requirements from users, customers, and stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and observation.
- Classifying and prioritizing requirements to focus on the most important features.
- Documenting requirements clearly and unambiguously, often in the form of requirement specifications.
- Validating requirements to ensure they are complete, feasible, and testable.
- Managing changes to requirements throughout the project lifecycle.

### Why is it important?

- Ensures that the final product meets user needs.
- Reduces the risk of costly changes later in development.
- Provides a clear roadmap for developers and testers.
