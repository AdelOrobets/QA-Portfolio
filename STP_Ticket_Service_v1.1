5. FEATURES NOT TO BE TESTED						
Internal workings of the payment gateway (only integration is tested)						
Third-party email service functionality beyond API response						
External analytics or tracking scripts						
						
6. APPROACH 						
Test cases will be created during exploratory testing.						
All test types are determined in Test Strategy.						
Team also must used experience-based testing and error guessing utilize testers skills and intuition, 
along with their experience with similar applications or technologies.						
The project is using an agile approach, with weekly iterations. At the end of each week the requirements identified for 
that iteration will be delivered to the team and will be tested. 						
						
7. ENTRY AND EXIT CRITERIA						
						
ENTRY:						
All test hardware platforms must have been successfully installed, configured, and functioning properly. 						
All the necessary documentation, design, and requirements information should be available that will allow testers 
to operate the system and judge the correct behavior.						
All the standard software tools including the testing tools must have been successfully installed and functioning properly.						
Proper test data is available.						
The test environment such as, lab, hardware, software, and system administration support should be ready.						
QA resources have completely understood the requirements 						
QA resources have sound knowledge of functionality						
Reviewed test scenarios, test cases and RTM						
						
EXIT:						
A certain level of requirements coverage has been achieved						
No high priority or severe bugs are left outstanding						
All high-risk areas have been fully tested, with only minor residual risks left outstanding						
Cost – when the budget has been spent						
The schedule has been achieved						
						
8. SUSPENSION CRITERIA AND RESUMPTION REQUIREMENTS 						
						
Suspension Criteria:						
The build contains many serious defects which seriously or limit testing progress.						
Significant change in requirements suggested by client						
Software/Hardware problems						
Assigned resources are not available when needed by test team.						
						
Resumption Requirements:						
Resumption will only occur when the problem(s) that caused the caused the suspension have been resolved						
						
9. ASSUMPTIONS & RISKS						
Technical Risks:	
Unstable server performance under a high number of simultaneous users.					
Errors in integration with payment systems.					
Incorrect functionality of the venue map on devices with different screen resolutions.					
						
Security Risks:
