This repository presents a detailed collection of *manual test cases* developed for the *User Registration* functionality. 
The test suite is based on real-world scenarios and reflects my approach to structured and thoughtful test design. 

Each test case includes:

- A unique identifier
- A clear title
- Preconditions
- Step-by-step instructions
- Expected results
- Postconditions
- Actual Results
- Test Environment
- Execution Status 

The goal of this test suite is to validate both the *functionality* 
and *security aspects* of the user registration process, covering:

- Form field validations
- Input boundary checks
- Password policy enforcement
- Responsive design testing
- Performance under load
- Error message handling
- Email confirmation and more

These test cases demonstrate my skills in:

- Requirements analysis
- Writing professional and comprehensive test documentation
- Thinking critically about edge cases and negative scenarios
- Ensuring a high-quality user experience

ðŸ›  Tools used:  

- Google Sheets  
- Test case writing standards  
- Manual execution practice

Feel free to explore the files, and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out with questions or feedback. 
I'm always open to collaboration and learning opportunities!
